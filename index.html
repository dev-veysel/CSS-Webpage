                <h3>Backend Development</h3>
                <p>
                    As an experienced backend developer, I have a strong understanding of the tools and technologies
                    necessary to build robust and scalable applications. I am well-versed in using IntelliJ as
                    my primary IDE and have experience in Java development, including the use of Hibernate and
                    Spring Boot.<br>
                    <br>
                    I am also experienced in working with databases, particularly MongoDB and PostgreSQL, and have a
                    solid understanding of how to manage efficient database structures. In addition, I
                    frequently use Slack for team communication and collaboration and rely on Linux as a
                    reliable operating system for hosting backend applications. In addition, I am familiar
                    working with Asana and Trello.<br>
                    <br>
                    When it comes to testing and debugging, I use Postman to ensure that APIs are functioning as
                    intended and to identify and resolve any issues that arise. I also leverage Github for
                    version control, allowing me to work collaboratively with my team members and maintain a
                    clean and organized codebase. <br>
                    <br>
                    Throughout the SDLC, I am mindful of incorporating design patterns into my work to ensure that I
                    am building applications in a way that is both efficient and scalable. By leveraging my
                    skills and experience with these tools and technologies, I am able to consistently deliver
                    high-quality applications that meet the needs of my clients and users.

                <h3>Frontend Development</h3>
                <p>
                    As a frontend developer, I am skilled in using VS Code, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, AWS, JavaScript,
                    SASS,
                    Webpack, React&Redux. I leverage these tools to build functional and visually appealing web
                    applications that are responsive, maintainable, and scalable.
